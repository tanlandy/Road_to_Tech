## Common operations
1. adding nodes
2. removing nodes
3. finding a node
4. traversing (or traveling through) the linked list

### Adding a new node
Adding a new node to the beginning of the list requires you to link your new node to the current head node. This way, you maintain your connection with the following nodes in the list.

### Removing a node
If you accidentally remove the single link to a node, that nodeâ€™s data and any following nodes could be lost to your application, leaving you with orphaned nodes.

To properly maintain the list when removing a node from the middle of a linked list, you need to be sure to adjust the link on the previous node so that it points to the following node.

# Linked Lists:

- Are comprised of nodes
- The nodes contain a link to the next node (and also the previous node for bidirectional linked lists)
- Can be unidirectional or bidirectional
- Are a basic data structure, and form the basis for many other data structures
- Have a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
- Require some maintenance in order to add or remove nodes
- The methods we used are an example and depend on the exact use case and/or programming language being used
