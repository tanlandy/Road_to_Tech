// Now Triangle has inherited traits from Shape, meaning it copied over class members from Shape. 
// When we use inheritance to extend a subclass from a superclass, we create an “is-a” relationship 
// from the subclass to the superclass. For example, an object of Triangle is a member of the Shape class;
//  however, an object of Shape is not necessarily an object of Triangle.
