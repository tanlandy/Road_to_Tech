A Java class can inherit fields and methods from another class.
Each Java class requires its own file, but only one class in a Java package needs a main() method.
Child classes inherit the parent constructor by default, but it’s possible to modify the constructor using super() or override it completely.
You can use protected and final to control child class access to parent class members.
Java’s OOP principle of polymorphism means you can use a child class object like a member of its parent class, but also give it its own traits.
You can override parent class methods in the child class, ideally using the @Override keyword.
It’s possible to use objects of different classes that share a parent class together in an array or ArrayList.
