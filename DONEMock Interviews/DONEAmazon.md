Question1: 
Introduction


What project/technology you like the most?

Code question -> 题做出来 + 沟通

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order. 

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc" 
Output: [0,6] 
Explanation: 
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc". 
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Define own function, write solution

Test case, test the solution step by step
Time complexity

要求：
思路要清晰，做出来同时最佳方法，命名规范
不叫solution




BQ -> 把故事理顺，不要陷入细节，把要点讲清楚
5 projects in your Resume, pick one, if you could, how to make it in a better way? -> 项目了解程度，学习提升的能力，要有一个细节点

Assume you join, and need to learn new things? -> 找资料，带着方案问人
1. Search online for basic understanding, what is about, what can do
2. Go through documentation, by team or start tutorials
3. If still confuse about something ,cannot find solution online or document, ask collegue or manager for help if they are availble.

2. manager knows more than me, and be more , ask for his suggestion
3. Receive manager's feedback, it's good thing to have this talk

Technical difficulty, one example? -> 看能不能坚持、尝试下来

-> Leadership principle
